# DATASUS SINAN data extraction
Hello world, in this project I will insert some codes, using R and RStudio, for extract data from Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) from the Brazilian Ministry of Health avaliable in the DATASUS website (https://datasus.saude.gov.br/transferencia-de-arquivos/#). With this workflow avaliable here, you can use File Transfer Protocol (FTP) for download the archives directly from the website. 

# Packages 
RCurl and curl

# Notes 
Before starting copying the codes, first you need to create a directory in your PC and initiate the Rstudio inside this directory.
